    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>20g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>toast, buttered, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Preparation</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until foaming. Whisk the eggs in a jug with a large pinch each of salt and ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is foaming, tip in the eggs and use a spatula to gently stir them around the pan until just set but not quite firm â€“ they will continue to cook after you turn off the heat. Divide between two plates and serve with buttered toast, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
