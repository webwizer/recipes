    <ul>
        <li>1½ pounds bone-in chicken breasts and/or thighs, trimmed</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peel and cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 celery rib, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 springs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>5 ounces spaghetti, broken into 1-inch pieces (1½ cups)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Preparation</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until simmering. Cook the chicken until well-browned all over, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add broth, onion, carrot, celery, thyme sprigs, bay leaf and 1/4 teaspoon salt, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until breasts register 160 degrees and/or thighs register at least 175 degrees, 14 to 17 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat; discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Transfer chicken to a plate and let cool slightly. Using two forks, shred chicken into bite-sized pieces, then discard skin and bones.</li>
        <li>Return soup to boil over medium-high heat and add pasta. Cook, uncovered, until pasta is tender, 9 to 11 minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and parsley and cook until chicken is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.</li>
